# Multiple Mutable References in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable references.  The `bug.rs` file showcases code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, highlighting the correct approach.

The issue stems from Rust's ownership and borrowing system, designed to prevent data races and ensure memory safety.  Attempting to have multiple mutable borrows of the same piece of data violates this system, resulting in a compile-time error in most cases.
